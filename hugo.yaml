    subtitle: "Senior Site Reliability Engineer"
    content: |
I’m a senior site reliability engineer and technical leader with extensive experience designing and guiding high-availability infrastructure in Kubernetes and OpenShift environments. My leadership approach blends deep technical expertise with a focus on collaboration, enabling teams to deliver reliable, scalable systems through automation and continuous improvement.

I lead by example (building solutions with tools like HELM, Terraform, Git, Jenkins, and ArgoCD) and fostering an environment where others can learn, experiment, and grow. I’m passionate about creating systems that empower teams to operate with confidence and autonomy. After several fulfilling years in large enterprise environments, I’m now seeking opportunities where reliability, ownership, and innovation meet to create lasting impact.

          I worked as a site reliability engineer at [Allianz Technology](https://tech.allianz.com/en.html) focusing on improving the resilience, scalability, and performance of sales operations systems. In this role, I designed and implemented infrastructure solutions using Kubernetes, OpenShift, HELM, Terraform, GitOps, Jenkins, and ArgoCD, ensuring reliable and automated deployments across multiple environments.

          Beyond the technical work, I led projects to migrate critical workloads to cloud platforms and introduced disaster recovery strategies that significantly reduced downtime and operational risk. I also improved monitoring and observability practices, helping teams respond faster to incidents and maintain system stability. Collaborating with international teams, I worked to streamline release processes and implement best practices for sustainable operational excellence.

          What I most value in my work is the intersection of technology and people. Building reliable systems is only part of the challenge, because enabling teams to collaborate effectively, share knowledge, and grow together is just as important. My time at Allianz deepened my expertise in cloud infrastructure and DevOps workflows, and reinforced my belief that thoughtful engineering and strong teamwork are the foundations of truly dependable systems.
