          After successfully completing the Federal Higher Technical Institute and after applying relevant engineering tasks for several years, I was granted the engineer's degree.

          During my studies, I participated in and won several coding contests, hackathons, and IBM Master the Mainframe events.

          My final diploma thesis focused on a fully automated all-in-one DevOps suite, fully configured and ready-to-go, which could be deployed using just one singular Dockerfile.
